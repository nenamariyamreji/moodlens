### Project Description
This project is a web-based platform designed to provide instant mental health support through interactive assessments and a conversational chatbot. The platform allows users to assess their mental health status through tests such as depression, anxiety, and loneliness, while also offering a chatbot that instantly provides empathetic responses and guidance. This integrated system aims to support individuals by offering them quick access to mental health evaluations and immediate, context-aware conversational help.

### The Problem statement
Mental health is an essential aspect of overall well-being, yet it is often neglected or overlooked in comparison to physical health. In today's fast-paced world, mental health issues such as anxiety, depression, stress, and loneliness are on the rise, affecting individuals across all demographics, especially young adults and working professionals. Many people do not have the resources or support systems to track, identify, and manage their mental health, leading to deterioration in both mental and physical health.

Despite the growing recognition of mental health importance, individuals still face challenges in accessing effective mental health care, understanding their mental state, and finding suitable interventions. Some of the barriers include:

Lack of Awareness: People are often unaware of the early signs of mental health issues, leading to delayed help-seeking behaviors.
Stigma: The stigma surrounding mental health conditions prevents individuals from seeking help, often out of fear of being judged or misunderstood.
Limited Access to Professional Support: Access to mental health professionals or resources is still limited in many parts of the world.
Difficulty in Monitoring Mental Health: People often struggle to track and assess their mental well-being effectively on a daily basis, leading to missed opportunities for intervention and improvement.
